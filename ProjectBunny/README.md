This is an object oriented based programming assignment.

It is a simulation of a population of bunnies that grow. The status of each individual bunny is contained in it's respective class object.

Each class object contains traits such as gender, name and status of the bunny.

The simulation of the growth of the bunny population may coincide with randomly generated events such as a population Cull, contagious vampire plague, 
or a food shortage. The simulation ends when the population of the bunnies stops.
